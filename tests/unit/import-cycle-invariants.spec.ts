/**
 * Unit Tests: the structural invariants that keep SWC-compiled builds from crashing.
 *
 * THE BUG CLASS
 * -------------
 * An import cycle is survivable on its own. It becomes FATAL when a TDZ-subject binding
 * (`const` / `class` / `let`) that crosses the cycle is dereferenced at MODULE-EVALUATION time —
 * in a decorator argument, in `design:type` / `design:paramtypes` metadata (which
 * `emitDecoratorMetadata` emits eagerly), in a static field initializer, or in a top-level
 * statement. Under SWC → CommonJS → Node's `require()` that reads a binding still in its temporal
 * dead zone:
 *
 *   ReferenceError: Cannot access 'X' before initialization
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT REDUNDANT
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * `pnpm run check:swc-tdz` catches the CRASH. It does not catch the DISARMING of a safety
 * property. Each invariant below is currently the only thing standing between a live cycle and a
 * crash, and every one of them can be reverted by a well-meaning refactor — an "organize imports",
 * a "modernize to arrow functions", a "split this file up" — WITHOUT anything turning red:
 * the code still compiles, all tests still pass, and `check:swc-tdz` still goes green, because the
 * cycle is disarmed-but-present rather than armed. The crash only appears later, for a consumer,
 * on a compiler this repo's default build never runs.
 *
 * So these tests assert the SAFETY PROPERTY itself, not its consequence. They are deliberately
 * structural. If one fails, do not "fix" it by relaxing the assertion — read the docblock it points
 * at.
 *
 * See .claude/rules/architecture.md → "DI Token Placement (SWC-Safe)".
